## Installation

Put the parent `GSVDashboard` into the `SuperTools` directory of a
location registered by the `KATANA_RESOURCES` env variable.

```batch
:: D:/myShelf/SuperTools/GSVDashboard/...
"ROOT=D:/myShelf"
"KATANA_RESOURCES=%ROOT%"
```

## Use

Make sure the node is always viewed when using `logical_upstream` mode.

### Parsing settings

If no setting is specified default are :

```python
excluded_gsv_names = ["gaffersate"]
excluded_as_groupnode_type = ["GafferThree"]
```

You can specify scene parsing setting dirctly in the `project.user` parameters,
or on a node in the scene.
To query the parameters from a node, it must be first specified in the project
parameters :

```
name=gsvdb_config_node, value=name of the node with the settings
```


Here are the supported `user` parameters names :

```markdown
- excluded_gsv_names(str): comma separated list
    - gsvdb_excluded_gsv_names: same as above
- excluded_as_grpnode_type(str): comma separated list
    - gsvdb_excluded_as_grpnode_type: _same as above_
```
